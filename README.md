Database of all Electric vehicles registered in the state of Washington, USA over the period 1997 to 2023 with focus on utilities and car makes to track registration details and to potentially help forecast future energy needs. It allows utilities, manufacturers, and policy planners to understand the movement of markets, how adoption rates vary by regions and utility areas and how they change over time. Before this the data is collated in different sources, with different data definitions making analysis difficult. Our objective is to remedy this â€“ along with reduce discrepancies, to perform strict privacy measures to protect user information, and limit errors in data handling. 
By collecting and analyzing this data, on EV ownership, I aim to contribute towards a more sustainable and environmentally friendly transportation future. The database can be leveraged to communities and regions can use the data to attract investments related to electric vehicle manufacturing, charging infrastructure, and other related industries. 
The overview of the project can be found in the pdf file.
